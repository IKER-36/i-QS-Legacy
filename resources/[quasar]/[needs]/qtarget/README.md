# Unsupported - Use [ox_target](https://github.com/overextended/ox_target) instead

qtarget has been largely unmaintained, receiving some occasional fixes and tweaks.  
There are issues with the ways many features were implemented, some from trying maintain compatibility with bt-target, but mostly janky patches on top of underlying flaws.

Development on a replacement is ongoing at [ox_target](https://github.com/overextended/ox_target), which will try to implement _some_ compatibility; however it cannot cover everything and will not attempt to patch poor-design decisions.

Some issues will be patched in qtarget if necessary, but it is dead (and should have been long ago).
